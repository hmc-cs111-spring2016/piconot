/**
 * Notes on combining blocked + open (from tues night):
 * can combine with "+" in the form "this.+(open(..), blocked(..))" without making our own wrapper class (simply unpack Surroundings and create new one),
 * However, to get proper binary operator (with the form, "open(..) + blocked(..)", we need to create our own class that mimics Surrounding because we'd need to define the operator inside it.
 * (^Unless I'm forgetting about something obvious)
 * Now our tuples might contain Surroundings or OurSurroundings (if users only pass in an 'open', for example, the '+' method will never be called, so the OurSurroundings will never get converted to a Surroundings).
 * So, we must cast both types of tuples to ShortRule.
