# A Picobot program that can fill an empty room
#
# This program shows some of the more and less
# verbose ways to say the same thing.

# States 0 and 1: move to the top left

# State 0: move left
(State 0, W x; Go W) # go all the way to the left
(State 0, W +; NewState 1)

# State 1: move up
(State 1, N x; Go N)
(State 1, N +, S x; Go S, newstate 2)

(State 2, south x; Go s)
(State 2, S +, E x; go East, newState 3)

(state 3, n x, s *, w *, e *; Go north, Newstate 3)
(State 3, N +, E x; Go E, NewState 2)

# The following is a more stylistically consistent version of the program above
#
# (state 0, w x; go w)
# (state 0, w +; newstate 1)
#
# (state 1, n x; go n)
# (state 1, n +, s x; go s, newstate 2)
# 
# (state 2, s x; go s)
# (state 2, e x, s +; go e, newstate 3)
# 
# (state 3, n x; go n)
# (state 3, n +, e x; go e, newstate 2)
