# A picobot program that can solve a maze, using the right-hand rule

moveUp:      # moving up
	If can move right, move right and moveRight     # we can go right
	If cannot move right but can move up, move up   # we can't go right, try going up
	If cannot move up or right, moveDown            # we can't go right or up, try turning around

moveRight:   # moving right
	If can move down, move down and moveDown             # we can go right
	If cannot move down but can move right, move right   # we can't go right, try going forward
	If cannot move right or down, moveLeft               # we can't go right or forward, try turning around

moveLeft:    # moving left
	If can move up, move up and moveUp               # we can go right
	If cannot move up but can move left, move left   # we can't go right, try going forward (west)
	If cannot move up or left, moveRight             # we can't go right or forward, try turning around

moveDown:    # moving down
	If can move left, move left and moveLeft           # we can go right
	If cannot move left but can move down, move down   # we can't go right, try going forward
	If cannot move left or down, moveUp                # we can't go right or forward, try turning around
